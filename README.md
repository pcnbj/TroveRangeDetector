It checks if all open Trove clients are in the defined range, the default is 32 cause I can't be bothered to find the loot sharing range.

Controls:
Ctrl5: Set main account (the client must be active when doing this).
Start: Start.

Display:
PID: PID of that client.
X, Y, Z: Coords.
Main: is this client the main client.
In Range: if it's the main account it shows if the client is in range of ALL other clients, if alt shows if is in range of main.
